# Advanced Port Scanner Using Python

## Domain
Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

## Description
This project is a Python-based advanced port scanner that scans
commonly used ports of a target system and identifies open ports.

It helps in understanding basic networking, socket programming,
and cybersecurity concepts.  
This project is developed for educational purposes only.

## Features
- Scans commonly used TCP ports
- Identifies and displays open ports
- Accepts IP address or domain name as input
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python code

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Socket Programming

## How It Works
The program uses Python socket programming to attempt connections
to a list of common ports on the target system.  
If the connection is successful, the port is marked as **OPEN**.

## How to run this project
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/tamilaruvi485-source/advanced-port-scanner-tamil
2. Install Python (if not installed)
3. Run:
   python port-code.py

## Output
- Takes target IP address or domain name as input
- Displays open ports in the terminal

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the code and output are included for reference.
